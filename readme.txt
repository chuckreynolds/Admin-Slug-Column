Put the slug of post and page into the admin columns

== Description ==
Simply put, this plugin adds the page and post slug into the admin columns.
I built this quickly out of necessity to help identify pages and posts by their slug as sometimes the titles clients give them don't match up nicely with the url slug; so here's a fast way to do that. Nothing fancy, just does what it does.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `admin-slug-column` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the Admin Slug Column plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Go to Posts or Pages and see the column showing your slug
1. Choose to hide/show the slug column in "Screen Options" tab up top
